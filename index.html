<h1>MONO//SPACED</h1>
<div id="container">
A MONOSPACED PARADIGM TO SEPARATE TWO ENTITIES, SUN AND MOON. IT'LL NEVER COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER, TWO SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT WORLDS. IT WAS SOL AND LUNA, FIRE AND WATER, SPACED BY A CHROMATICAL PLACE NAMED EARTH. IT'S THE SAME LIKE US, TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES WITH DIFFERENT MIND, VOW TO LIVE AND SHARE OUR LIFE TOGETHER. TILL DEATH DO US APART.
