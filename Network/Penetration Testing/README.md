As general rule of thumb, when doing Penetration Testing, Forensics, Red/Blue Teaming, or other stuff that are based on Cyber Security, you should do it over VIRTUAL MACHINE, and do not use your daily driver to do this. You should do this inside a VM and passthrough the USB through VirtualBox or QEMU depending on what you use. It is advisable to DO NOT CONNECT VPN like HackTheBox to your host, do it INSIDE VIRTUAL MACHINE as you're sharing your connection with other trained hackers inside those CTFs VPN.

If you're not sure of what you're doing, please refer to Cyber Security sections in this github repo or research about networking basics before you go into Digital Forensics or Cyber Security. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
